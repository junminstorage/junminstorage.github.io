        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        	<p>NodeJS was and is still hot. The fact companies like IBM are starting to take it over saying a lot about the its potentials. 
        	It is based on Javascript and use Chrome V8 engine as runtime, which make it possible to write application servers. 
        	One of its bragging points is non-blocking single thread processed using javascript's event loop. Note this architecture is not new, 
        	one of <a id='nginx' href='http://www.aosabook.org/en/nginx.html'>Nignx</a> paper talked about its idea to create web server with 
        	single thread process while achieving high concurrency. It allows developers to deliver the functionality of both a web server 
        	and an application server plus web UI in single languages. Node.js is considered a key component for microservices-based development and delivery.  
        	
        	While this is great on paper, but advocates tend to tell great stories like <a href='http://www.jayway.com/2015/04/13/600k-concurrent-websocket-connections-on-aws-using-node-js/'>this</a>.
        	Reality is not true, to use any tools, frameworks or languages requires hard work and deep understanding of what it can do and what it can not do. In this paper I will point out the issues 
        	with develop web server using Node.js.

		<h3>Nodejs as web server</h3>
		<p>One of the most popular Node.js web framework is Express, using its HTTP routing methods with various template engines with Express. Developing web server seems super easy. Let's look at its example. 
		</p>
		<code>
	var express = require('express');
	var app = express();
	app.get('/', function (req, res) {
		//doing some non-blocking IO stuffs, e.g. query db or api calls
		non-blocking-call().then(function(){
  					res.send('Hello World!');
  		}catch(function(ex){
  					res.status(500).send('sorry');
  		})
  				
	});
		</code>
		<p>To use a template engine, here are the few lines</p>
		<code>
	app.set('view engine', 'jade');
	app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  		res.render('index', { title: 'Hey', message: 'Hello there!'});
	});
		</code>
		<p>This is great. 10k concurrent connections, right? But like a post office, if the window man doesn't accept mails quickly and pass on, all of the 
		mail delivery trucks are no use and mails are stuck, in this Node.js case, at event loop. Here are few problems or things go wrong 
		I encountered during Nodejs web server development.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				res.send() is blocking call, if we send large chunk of data saying a few megabytes like videos or images, it blocks the event-loop! 
				So often times a Apache or Nignx web server is being used to serve up its static content like JS, CSS and images, also acting as 
				load balancer to direct traffic to Node.js servers. Also for high traffic likes news sites static content are often cached at content delivery network (CDN). 
			</li>
			
			<li>
				 One of the typical usage to send json response by res.json() call. If the json data is highly complex and large, this becomes 
				 event-loop blocking again. See this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22046758/nodejs-json-stringify-bottleneck">stackoverflow</a> post for discussion and potential 
				 solutions such as using JSONStream. 
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Node.js like other scripting languages like python are not performant for high computing stuffs. One of the issues I saw in one project is to generate a huge HTML form based on json schema
				fetched from back-end data store. The html form itself is wrapped in a JSON response. there is complicated business logic involved to manipulate the json from multiple data sources and construct the AngularJS-based html form. The whole approach is 
				questionable at first place. And this cause the performance of whole node.js server down-graded dramatically.  
			</li>
