        	NodeJS was and is still hot. The fact companies like IBM are starting to take it over saying a lot about the its potentials. 
        	It is based on Javascript and use Chrome V8 engine as runtime, which make it possible to write application servers. 
        	One of its bragging points is non-blocking single thread processed using javascript's event loop. Note this architecture is not new, 
        	one of <a id='nginx' href='http://www.aosabook.org/en/nginx.html'>Nignx</a> paper talked about its idea to create web server with 
        	single thread process while achieving high concurrency. It allows developers to deliver the functionality of both a web server 
        	and an application server plus web UI in single languages. Node.js is considered a key component for microservices-based development and delivery.  
        	
        	While this is great on paper, but advocates tend to tell great stories like <a href='http://www.jayway.com/2015/04/13/600k-concurrent-websocket-connections-on-aws-using-node-js/'>this</a>.
        	Reality is not true, to use any tools, frameworks or languages requires hard work and deep understanding of what it can do and what it can not do. In this paper I will point out the issues 
        	with develop web server using Node.js.

<p>I have been enjoying software development for over ten years. I often spend weekends and nights to learn 
and try out new technologies, work on some ideas I come out by myself or collaborate with 
some developers which I never met. I also maintain an <a href="http://blueocean-penn.blogspot.com/">blog</a> 
which I write down some thoughts and experiences as a software engineer, also use it to solve some code interview problems as I found those questions intriguing.</p>
