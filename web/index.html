        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        	<p>NodeJS was and is still hot. The fact that companies like <a href="https://strongloop.com/strongblog/node-js-community-ibm-acquisition/">IBM</a> are starting to take it over saying a lot about the its potentials. 
        	It is based on Javascript and use Chrome V8 engine as runtime, which make it possible to write application servers. 
        	One of its bragging points is non-blocking single thread process using javascript's event loop. Note this architecture is not new, 
        	one of <a id='nginx' href='http://www.aosabook.org/en/nginx.html'>Nignx</a> paper talked about its idea to create web server with 
        	single thread process while achieving high concurrency. It allows developers to deliver the functionality of both a web server 
        	and an application server plus web UI in single languages. Node.js is considered a key component for microservices-based development and delivery.  
        	
        	While this is great on paper, but advocates tend to tell great stories like <a href='http://www.jayway.com/2015/04/13/600k-concurrent-websocket-connections-on-aws-using-node-js/'>this</a>.
        	Reality is more real, to use any tools, frameworks or languages requires hard work and deep understanding of what it can do and what it can not do. In this paper I will point out some issues 
        	I saw when developing web server using Node.js.

      <section id="main_content">
		<h3>Node.js as web server</h3>
		<p>One of the most popular Node.js web framework is Express, using its HTTP routing methods with various template engines. Developing web server seems super easy. Let's look at its example. 
		</p>
		<pre>
var express = require('express');
var app = express();
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
	//doing some non-blocking IO stuffs, e.g. query db or api calls
	non-blocking-call().then(function(){
  			res.send('Hello World!');
  	}catch(function(ex){
  			res.status(500).send('sorry');
  	})
  				
});
		</pre>
		<p>To use a template engine, just add few more lines</p>
		
		<pre>
app.set('view engine', 'jade');
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  	res.render('index', { title: 'Hey', message: 'Hello there!'});
});
		</pre>
		
		<p>This is great. 10k concurrent connections, right? But like a post office, if the window man doesn't accept mails quickly and pass on, all of the 
		mail delivery trucks are no use and mails are stuck at window, in this Node.js case, at event loop. Here are few problems or things go wrong 
		during Node.js web server development.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				res.send() is a blocking call, if we send large chunk of data saying a few megabytes like PDFs or images, it blocks the event-loop! 
				So often times a Apache or Nignx web server is being used as proxy to serve up its static content like JS, CSS and images, also acting as 
				load balancer to direct traffic to Node.js servers. Also for high traffic likes news sites static content are often cached at content delivery network (CDN). 
			</li>
			
			<li>
				 One of the typical usage to send json response by res.json() call. If the json data is highly complex and large, this becomes 
				 event-loop blocking again. See this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22046758/nodejs-json-stringify-bottleneck">stackoverflow</a> post for discussion and potential 
				 solutions such as using JSONStream. 
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Node.js like other scripting languages like python are not performant for high computing stuffs. One of the issues I saw in one project is to generate a huge HTML form based on json schema
				fetched from back-end data store. The html form itself is wrapped in a JSON response. there is complicated business logic involved to manipulate the json from multiple data sources and construct the AngularJS-based html form. The whole approach is 
				questionable at first place. And this cause the performance of whole node.js server down-graded dramatically.  
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Another problem with using template engine's condition logic, which is evil to my opinion. Like the following from Jade's reference page. 
				<pre>
- var user = { description: 'foo bar baz' }
- var authorised = false
#user
  if user.description
    h2 Description
    p.description= user.description
  else if authorised
    h2 Description
    p.description.
      User has no description,
      why not add one...
  else
    h1 Description
    p.description User has no description			
				</pre>
				
				In reality when developers start to implement complex business logic using template condition logic, things becomes even worse. Now you have logic everywhere, Node.js backend, templates, and then browser JS.
				
			</li>
			<li>To make thing worse, jade-based dynamic page generation is CPU bound due to its cost.  Even with simple templates, generating HTML pages is expensive.</li>
			<li>
				To make thing even worse, if user interactions with the site triggers HTTP requests which use HTML form to post data to Node.js server, server process the request, then construct another HTML page using template engine and send it back. 
				Not only the whole page is refreshed along with redundant data like JS/images/CSS, even static content is cached, but it still takes over some of browser's CPU usage. Saying user just wants to update his/her first on a user profile page
				and nothing else, but the whole user profile data is being sent over again from server. 
			</li>
			
		</ul>

	  		<h3>Development solutions</h3>
	  		<p>For any problems, there will be solutions or mitigation plans. Actually the above section already points out some tips or best practices.
	  		<ul>
	  			<li>Serve static content via Nignx/Apache, or for large webs particularly news site with lots of videos content, put up the content to edge network like CDN. 
	  			<li>Implement node.js server in cluster mode using cluster package. The below we create 1 master and 2 workers which will compete for the same port for incoming requests.
	  			<pre>
var cluster = require('cluster')

if ( cluster.isMaster ) {
  for ( var i=0; i<2; ++i )
    cluster.fork();
} else {
	do whatever you do in single node		
			
}
				</pre>
	  			<li>Event better have a node.js server cluster reverse proxying by a load balancer. Also terminate an SSL/TLS connection to the client at NGINX side, the communication between NGINX and Node.js is unencrypted.</li>
	  			<li>Measure the event loop lags, there are some great tools like <a href="https://github.com/lloyd/node-toobusy">toobusy</a> can help us</li>
	  			<li>Lastly fully take advantage JS's event loop and callbacks. Do not do heavy computing stuffs in JS.</li>	  			
	  		</ul>
	  		
			<h3>An architecture solution</h3>
			<p>Looking at the above examples, what goes wrong there? So what are the potential solutions? I believe an architecture design needs to be made. Node.js is great for implementing core process or acting as API gateways on top of micro-services. 
			But using Node.js to develop a complex web servers could lead to problems or even disaster. Along with html generation at server side, this becomes no difference from other technologies like JSP/PHP. 
			</p>
			<p>
			See this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5062614/how-do-i-decide-when-to-use-node-js?rq=1">stackoverflow</a> post about where we should and should not use Node.js.
			MEAN stack's AngularJS and Node.js combinations is not only a suite of tools but an architecture. Node.js should go back to what it does best, keeping persistent connections from client and serving up web socket, being application servers to serve up the Restful APIs. HTML templates should not contains complex logic and should
			serve from server side. Let AngularJS-based single page application to make ajax call to fetch data from Node.js API server and manipulate the DOM and handle the display.   
			</p>
			<p>
			Few years ago, coming from Java/JSP/Servlet background, when I first experienced with SPA development, it is truly mind-blowing. The javascript has become real powerful to handle browser-side and server-side as well. But as for tools or programming languages we try to learn and use, 
			knowing how is great, but knowing not-to and should-not is at another level, which needs hard work and continuous learning and research. 
			</p>
